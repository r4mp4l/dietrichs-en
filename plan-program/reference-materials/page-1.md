## Implementation Strategy

1. **Documentation Restructuring**: Create clear learning paths based on user roles and experience levels
2. **Demonstration Projects**: Develop 3-5 expert-built model examples
3. **Guided Walkthroughs**: Provide step-by-step explanations of expert thinking
4. **Integrated Learning**: Connect documentation directly to model examples

## Learning Philosophy

Our approach is grounded in established educational theory (cognitive apprenticeship, situated learning) that shows complex technical skills are best learned through:

1. **Observation** of expert practice
2. **Imitation** of proven workflows
3. **Guided practice** with increasing independence
4. **Integration** of theoretical concepts with practical application

This shift from isolated feature learning to observational learning of complete workflows will significantly enhance user experience and reduce support requirements.
