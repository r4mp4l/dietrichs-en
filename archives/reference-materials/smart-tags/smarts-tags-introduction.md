# Introduction to Smart Tags

## Pre-requisites
Before working with SmartTags, users should be comfortable with:
- Basic navigation in Dietrich's software
- D-CAM module functionality and operations
- Working with workplanes
- Understanding of machining operations and single beam info
- Basic knowledge of variables
- Familiarity with components and objects

## What are SmartTags and When to Use Them
SmartTags are powerful automation tools in Dietrich's that allow you to group and apply machining operations across components. They are especially valuable when you need to:
- Automate repetitive machining operations
- Create standardized machining patterns that can be quickly applied
- Apply operations that need to dynamically adapt based on component properties
- Streamline the placement of hardware and fittings
- Think of SmartTags as "smart macros" that can not only replicate operations but also intelligently adapt them based on the components they're applied to.

### Key Benefits
- Time Savings: Dramatically reduce time spent on repetitive machining operations
- Consistency: Ensure standardized machining patterns across similar components
- Flexibility: Operations can adapt dynamically using variables and component properties
- Efficiency: Apply multiple operations simultaneously to one or more components
- Quality Control: Reduce errors by standardizing common operations
Core Features

### SmartTags can:

- Integrate any machining operations available in single member components
- Use variables for flexible and dynamic operations
- Access component properties to calculate dimensions
- Place objects from libraries using point symbols
- Be combined with other automation elements for enhanced efficiency

### Basic Structure
A SmartTag typically consists of:
- Variables (optional) - Define parameters that can be adjusted
- Operations - The actual machining instructions
- Conditions (optional) - Rules for when/how operations are applied
- Component references - How the tag interacts with selected components

### Where to Use SmartTags
SmartTags can be used in multiple modules:
- D-CAM
- Wall design
- Floor design
- Roof design
- Further Learning

To build expertise with SmartTags, we recommend:
- Start with simple operations before creating complex SmartTags
- Practice using variables to make SmartTags more flexible
- Experiment with different component types and operations
- Learn to combine SmartTags with other automation features

## Next Steps
After understanding these basics, users should:
- Learn to access the SmartTag editor in D-CAM
- Practice creating basic SmartTags
- Explore variable integration
- Study advanced SmartTag features

This introduction provides the foundation for working with SmartTags. Future articles will cover specific aspects in more detail, including creation, editing, and advanced usage scenarios.
