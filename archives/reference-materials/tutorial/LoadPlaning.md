# Aim of the document

> In this training document the loading planning is presented and shown by means of examples. The training is divided into three categories. In the category **Basis**, the tools and possibilities will be shown and introduced. In the **Buildup** category, the application of these tools is further deepened. Training content in the Expert category provides further opportunities for settings.
>
> To start with a specific chapter, the used project can be downloaded under the following link:
>
> The default settings from the delivery version are used for this tutorial.

-   Work instructions are marked in blue, with a dot in front of them

-   

-   General explanations are written in black.

> Explanations to the program are marked in blue, without a dot in front of it.

# Introduction and basic understanding

> Dietrich\'s Loading Planning is designed to support the loading planner in the convenient implementation of his know-how. To make this possible, many new technologies have been

> incorporated into the program. The following pages contain an explanation of how the loading planning is structured.

## Loading components

> Different objects are loaded during the loading planning:

-   Individual components

-   Components

-   Elements of wall, ceiling and roof

-   Complete building elements (wall, ceiling, roof) These are called **load components**.

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image5.jpeg){width="2.698611111111111in" height="3.9in"}

## Vehicles and loading equipment

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image6.jpeg){width="3.142361111111111in" height="5.308333333333334in"}The loading components are loaded onto so-called **loading aids**. Loading aids are for example platforms, loading racks, A-frames and other types.
>
> These loading aids are in turn loaded onto trucks, trailers or other means of transport. These are summarized under the term **vehicles**.
>
> Vehicles are needed because deliveries are planned and scheduled. The loading aids are distributed on the vehicles.
>
> Notes

## Load planning

> In the loading position the loading components, vehicles and loading aids are brought together. The loading components come from building positions. Vehicles and loading aids are inserted into the loading position from a library or are already available in the template.

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image7.jpeg){width="6.231763998250218in" height="2.7133333333333334in"}

> The loading item is a separate position type, since several building positions can be loaded here.
>
> In the same way, not all information of the structure has to be available for the loading planning. For example, slice contours, logic blocks elements or machine processing (apart from the shape of the component) are not decisive for loading. This makes it easier and faster to manage the loading process.
>
> It also allows several buildings to be planned in one loading position. The buildings are linked to the loading position. If there is a change in the structure, the structure can be synchronized with the loading position and the loaded can be adjusted.
>
> Notes

> Notes

## Split screen

> Loading planning is basically divided into two areas. The loading itself and the loaded structures. To make it easier to distinguish and work with, these two areas can be divided into two separate graphic areas. Here, in addition to working in one window, there is the possibility of a split window or two separate windows.

-   9-08-1 „one graphics window" ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image12.png){width="0.22847112860892388in" height="0.23873578302712162in"}

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image15.jpeg){width="5.474273840769904in" height="2.4779166666666668in"}The size of the respective window can be easily moved with the mouse by moving the dividing line in the middle.
>
> Rendering via the OpenGL workspace can be selected separately for each window!
>
> Notes

## Display settings of the windows

> For loading on the left side, you will find the display setting at the bottom left. Depending on the loading component being loaded, a different display setup can be beneficial.
>
> For the window of the loaded structure, you will find the display settings, as usual, under 1 -7-1.
>
> The left window is optimized for placing the loading components, the right window for selecting the loading components.

-   1-7-1 Set display settings to favorite \"Walls\", activate only story TF -\> Hide loaded components

-   Display left on \"all vehicles - components

> There are already loading aids on the vehicles shown. We can also see these in the loading tree at the top left. Load Carrier, in this case an L-frame, is placed on the vehicles. The loading aids are included with most of the vehicles supplied.

-   Click on the + in the loading tree in front of 1. 7.5t Flatbed truck with T-frame

-   1.1 Select T Frame

-   Display setting, switch to favorite 4 \"current loading aid - components\".

> There is also the same control of weights and payloads for loading equipment as there is for vehicles.
>
> The loading aids are shown here in a very simplified way to allow easy placement.
>
> Here, too, there are various supplied loading aids.

-   Access the library of loading aids

> Each loading equipment has its own loading levels, where the loading components are inserted.
>
> Notes

## Loading levels

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image31.jpeg)

> Loading levels are determined by working planes. Loading levels are the levels in which the loading components can be inserted. This simplifies the loading of the loading components and links them organizationally to the respective loading level.
>
> Plans can then be generated later from the individual loading levels. This way you get the exact loading for each level.

-   In the loading tree, unfold the vehicles/load carrier and the loading level.

-   1 vertical right -\> click 1 loading level

> This changes the view in the loading perpendicular to the loading plane. This has to do with the positioning chosen, which will be discussed in the next chapters. Loading components can only be loaded once a loading level has been selected!
>
> Since several components are usually placed next to and on top of each other on a loading aid, one loading level is not sufficient. Additional loading levels can be easily created.

-   View of loading turned into perspective

-   Button: Create new loading level -\> Thickness of loading plane to 1m

-   Button \"create, offer next\" until there are three pieces in total per side

> This function allows you to create multiple loading layers at once. The thickness of the loading level determines the distance between the loading levels to suit. The loading levels can be pushed together after loading. Precise adjustment of the thickness is possible, but not mandatory.
>
> Notes

## Practicing on your own Procedure:

1)  Create position for loading - V10

2)  New vehicle load, 7.5 Flatbed truck with T-frame

3)  Load building - same building - same settings when loading

4)  Add loading levels

5)  Two windows / One window - OpenGL workspace

6)  Set display settings

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image34.jpeg){width="5.1323479877515314in" height="3.611978346456693in"}

> Notes

# Basic: Loading

> Individual components, elements or assemblies can be loaded onto the previously set up loading levels.
>
> When loading these loading components, one component is selected in the right window. Then the loading component hangs directly on the cursor in the left window. Various functions are available for placing the component.

-   1 vertical left - select 1 loading level of the 1st truck_7.5t

-   7-2-1 \"Load Loading components" ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image35.png){width="0.22847222222222222in" height="0.2382075678040245in"}, Select the loading component (gable triangle wall) and position it on the loading plane.

> You can see how the loaded component on the right is no longer present due to the settings made in the display settings.
>
> The component to be loaded hangs on the cursor and is placed along the X-axis of the loading plane.

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image36.jpeg){width="6.6080500874890635in" height="2.3516666666666666in"}

> Components that have already been loaded can also be unloaded again.

-   Unload the loading components (function 7 -2-5 ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image37.png){width="0.22847112860892388in" height="0.23863845144356954in"}) These appear, with this display setting, again in the position.

> Notes

## Rotate during insertion

> When a load component is selected, it is located on the cursor in the load. There, it can be rotated, mirrored and flipped using various key combinations.
>
> TAB = Rotate around the X axis (90° steps) Shift + TAB = Rotate around the Z-axis (180°)
>
> Ctrl + TAB = Rotate around the Y axis (90°)
>
> This allows the loading component to be easily aligned and fit into the desired position.

-   Rotate view of loading with 9-1-1 \"Arbitrary\".

-   • 7-2-1 \"Load Loading components" ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image35.png){width="0.22847112860892388in" height="0.2388604549431321in"} → Apply rotate functions, then end function with mouse-right

## Positioning options

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image39.png){width="3.5937981189851267in" height="0.2708333333333333in"}Depending on the loading component, different views are often required for positioning. Four variants are available for positioning the loading component.
>
> 3D: Free input in 3D, any view
>
> A_3D: Input in work plane in 3D, any view
>
> A_2Dxy: Input in work plane, preferred view on XoY of the work plane A_2Dzx: Input in work plane, preferred view on ZoX of the work plane
>
> If you select one of the variants, you can make further settings for the positioning.
>
> Distance to working plane: With a value of 0, the loading component is placed flush on the loading plane. A distance causes a displacement parallel to the loading plane in the Z direction.
>
> Distance to X-axis of the work plane: A distance causes a displacement parallel to the X-axis of the loading plane.
>
> Both functions are especially helpful if you have entered additional spacers or other, so-called loading timbers or if components are to be loaded interlaced.

-   Distance to the X-axis of the work plane 0.08m

-   Catch points off

-   Load another gable Triangle

> Notes

## Ctrl Key during loading

> The current loading level is already filled. You would be able to fit the gable triangle using the rotate functions, but in this case this loading component is to be loaded into a new loading plane.
>
> For this you can change the loading level within the loading function.

-   Gable triangle hangs on crosshairs/ cursor - Press CTRL key and select 2 loading level.

> You can see that the loading component of the other loading level have a different representation than the component that is currently being loaded. This becomes particularly clear in the OpenGL workspace. In this case, the other loading layers should also be hidden.

# Advanced: Preparation structure

-   Create new loading position (with vehicles)

-   Load Building

-   Dialogue \"Loading buildings\"

> In order for a structure and its loading components to be loaded realistically in the loading position, settings must already be made and things prepared in the building position. The components that you want to load are determined when you load the building position. Only these are then present in the loading position. For this distinction to be possible, the structure must be prepared accordingly.

## ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image51.jpeg){width="2.8826388888888888in" height="3.341665573053368in"}Which loading components are there

> The following loading components must be distinguished:

-   [Single objects in packages:]{.underline} Components that don\'t belong to an element to be loaded, but to a package

-   [Components]{.underline}: if not belonging to an element to be loaded

-   [Elements:]{.underline} if they are to be loaded as such

-   [Wall volumes, Floor-and roof slice panels]{.underline}

-   [Single objects:]{.underline} not in elements or packages to be loaded

> Depending on the settings in the building, the components are filtered according to these categories when they are loaded.

-   Not all components of an element are automatically included in the load component. Which components are to be \"included\" is determined by determining the center of gravity (in wall, ceiling and roof). The group to which the components belong is decisive here. Individual components can be excluded via the beam type number. Connectors and fasteners can be excluded via an extra switch.

> Notes

## Components

1.  Components are loaded as such if they do not belong to an element or a building element that is to be loaded as a unit. The single objects always remain in the \"group\" of the component. The building MOS, group and beam type of the first object of the component determine what element or building element and then loading component the component belongs to.

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image55.jpeg){width="7.89294072615923in" height="2.1175in"}

-   Load structure, tick only \" components \".

-   Component integrated into ceiling element (steel girder from ceiling 1 E04) does not come with the ceiling element

> Notes

## Individual parts

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image56.jpeg){width="7.18650043744532in" height="1.8540616797900262in"}

> Individual parts that are to be loaded as such must not belong to the following loading components or be included via the center of gravity determination:

-   Components

-   Element loaded as one unit

-   Building element loaded as a unit

-   So, if a component belongs to an element or building element (mostly the case), it can still be taken out via its group membership or the beam type number exclusion.

> A further subdivision in the individual components is the affiliation to a package. This MOS affiliation means that the components are loaded as \"individual components in packages\".

-   Load structure, tick only component types from \"Individual components\" group

-   Examples: sole plates, purlins, chimney trimmers from collar beam ceiling.

-   Create a package named \"Purlins\" in the structure, assign the purlins, reload the structure→ Purlins do not appear, reload with \"single components in packages→ Purlins only

## Practicing on your own

## Substitute representation

> In the representation settings for the structure, you can also activate a substitute representation for components and elements instead of the original volumes. This provides a simplified view of the loading components, both for selection and for placement on the loading equipment.
>
> The replacement representations are created from the bounding box of the included components with corresponding protrusions for protruding individual components. With the function \"Properties substitute representation\" (7-2-03) you can control the optical nature of the formed volumes.

>
> In accordance with this, it is recommended to load in the OpenGl workspace with substitute representations.

-   Loading HRB walls onto L-frame

-   Moving individual elements and entire levels

> For example, cross laminated timber elements, but also wooden beam ceiling elements can be loaded horizontally. It may even be possible to stack the individual elements in an interlocking manner.

-   ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image59.jpeg){width="5.067191601049869in" height="3.6in"}„ Pushing together\" the corresponding load planes (by thickness).

> Individual components can be the only loading components of a project (e.g., log buildings or roof framing components), but they can also be a supplement to prefabricated elements. In the latter case, the task is to fill the resulting gaps in element loading as efficiently as possible.
>
> Notes

-   Loading of individual components into gaps between collar beam ceiling elements

## Other options in Load Levels

## Input of loading timbers

> Normal\" components can be entered in the Load Levels. In this way, for example, loading timbers can be generated.

-   Input of loading timbers along the X-axis of the L-frame

> These components belong organizationally to the respective selected loading level and can therefore also be switched accordingly in the display settings. These components are also taken into account separately during plan storage and are placed on their own material list.

## ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image60.jpeg){width="4.269443350831146in" height="3.400803805774278in"}Input of drawing elements

-   visual control, supported by the program, whether there are collisions or protrusions

-   the possibility of reloading the structure into the loading, if there was a change in it. Of course, as much as possible of the existing loading should be preserved.

# Structure: Plans

> This chapter will go into more detail about the plan settings and the prerequisites for the plan files.

## Prerequisites

> As already described in the chapter Plan output, the views for the plan output come from the component of the vehicle and load carrier. Any number of views can be defined in the components. However, for the sake of consistency, it is a good idea to use the views corresponding to the vehicles and load carriers supplied.

-   ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image48.jpeg){width="2.34375in" height="2.34375in"}![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image70.png){width="2.408695319335083in" height="2.1390616797900264in"}Right click on load carrier -\> Change load carrier

> The views used are indicated on the vehicle and on the load carrier. The position of the view is determined by the component matrix.
>
> View 1 therefore shares the same position as views 2 and 5. Accordingly, you should not have them set in the vehicle at the same time, otherwise they will overlap on the plan.
>
> Notes

## Labeling

> The settings of the labeling and on which views they are displayed are defined in the load carrier or vehicle.
>
> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image71.jpeg){width="6.343821084864392in" height="4.536457786526684in"}The labels of the load levels are also set on the load carrier.
>
> This means that you have to change relatively little or nothing in the storage setting of the pl an, but change it directly on the vehicles and load carriers depending on the situation and loading. Therefore, all plans can also be generated at once and you still get the matching results. For example, side view is less important than top view for a flatbed with multiple nested components. With an L-Frame, the situation is different again. Nevertheless, both can be filed with the same plan storage setting.
>
> Preparation therefore takes place primarily in the structure and therefore reacts much more flexibly to different loading situations.
>
> Notes

## Overall plan

> The overall plan shows the load carrier or the vehicle and its load carrier loaded on it. Also, the loading list and the material list of the loading timbers are displayed on it. So, this is the overall plan.

-   In the finished overall plan in the legend - right click on text -\> edit text

> Notes

## Load level plan

> On the load level plan, the individual load levels are shown in the top view of the loading level. On it can also be visible the load timbers and labeling/texts of the load level. The size of the view is determined by the size of the load plane. This can be adjusted by using the grid settings.

> The hatching can be set separately from the overall plan. Hier gilt das gleiche wie beim Gesamtplan.
>
> The dimensioning measures the distance of the load from the load plane. Also, overhangs can be dimensioned by this, depending on how large the individual load level is set in the grid settings in the loading position.

> It is therefore particularly worthwhile in loading, as you can represent the entire fleet in a template and then only have to fill it with loading components.
>
> Also, loading timbers can already be entered in the load levels, which are always used with a certain loading component. For example, anti-slip mats or battens when loading CLT.
>
> A template for loading can be saved using the 1-3-1 \"Save as template\" function.

## Component\'s

> Vehicles and loading equipment are components that can be created in different levels of detail. Depending on how the representation is desired. Vehicles and load carriers must always contain a volume that represents the loading space. This has beam type 921 - load room. This loading space is inserted purely for visual inspection. You can see whether the load carriers and loading components each fit into the vehicle and the load carrier and nothing protrudes.
>
> The components already contain the views that can be selected later as views in the loading plan. All vehicles and load carriers included in the program have the views shown in the picture with the numbers and positions described. Following these guidelines creates reliability and routine in the process of creating your plans. Therefore, when creating the component, the coordinate system must always be defined in such a way that the views provide the desired result.

## Vehicle

> After completing the component of a vehicle, it can be placed in a loading position as a vehicle. The \"Create new vehicle\" function (7-4-5) opens a dialog box in which you select the component, define the name and weights, specify the desired views for the plan and select the labeling.
>
> This defines a new vehicle and it can be used in this position. In order to make it available for loading a new vehicle (in all positions), it must still be stored in a corresponding library. The \"Load planning libraries\" function (1-5-4) opens a dialog similar to that of the volume libraries. Resize information can also be saved here in order to design the vehicles flexibly with regard to their geometry.
>
> From this library, a vehicle can be loaded into any loading position using the same function or by

-   Create a new vehicle

-   Change the newly applied vehicle

-   Save to library with Resize (set) specific dimensions

-   Read from library

# Expert: Your own load carrier

> The load carriers are also created from corresponding components. A volume for the load area with beam type 921 - Load area must be available and the views should be set accordingly in the assembly.

## Load levels

> Load carriers, unlike vehicles, must contain the load levels. For this purpose, corresponding work planes are created with the functions of menu 9-2.
>
> The work planes must have the correct position and orientation on the loading equipment. The XoY plane is the one in which the loading components will later be placed. The Z-axis points in the direction in which further layers of this load level group can be created. For example, the horizontal load level of a flatbed or a trestle is just as horizontal with respect to XoY as it is globally XoY. The base work plane for this is therefore on the top edge of the load carrier with the zero point at the corner and the Z axis pointing upwards. In the grid settings of the work plane, you can set the size according to the loading area and define a desired grid for later point snap.

> In this way, a work plane must be created for each desired group of load levels.

-   Create the three work planes vertical right, vertical left and horizontal

## Load carrier

> The prepared component and the work planes now become the load carrier in the loading position using the \"Create new load carrier\" function (7 -4-03). To create one, however, a vehicle must also be present in the loading position. Only then can a load carrier be created.

![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image81.jpeg){width="5.940016404199475in" height="4.738020559930009in"}

> When the loading equipment has been defined, it can be saved to a loading planning library using the same function as before for the vehicle. Again, it is possible to create a variable element by using Resize.

-   Create load carrier

> Notes

-   Save in library

> If you save a vehicle that contains one or more load carriers to the library, it will automatically contain the load carriers when read from the library. This means that you can create \"empty\" vehicles, but also combinations that are already \"ready to use\".

## Practicing own your own

> Enter suitable work planes, create load carrier, save in library with resize, save a vehicle/load carrier combination (e.g transporter with flatbed).

# Expert: Loading list

> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image82.jpeg){width="3.4482950568678916in" height="1.6675in"}The loading list is displayed on the overall plan and contains all the set information about the loaded components.
>
> ![](mediaLoadPlanning/media/image83.jpeg){width="5.288955599300087in" height="1.8715616797900263in"}How this list is structured and what information is transferred in it is set in the plan storage of the load drawing. In the \"Lists\" category you can find the following settings.
>
> Basically, each line is just a multi-line text with key words/variables that are automatically filled in during plan storage. This multiline text can be changed using the \"Edit\" button.
>
> Since it can happen that a line is not used but should not be deleted either, you can simply switch it off using the checkbox.
>
> Spaces, tab characters and line breaks are also transferred. This allows the loading list to be customized.
>
> [Example:]{.underline}
>
> There is a completely empty line before the load level. This is entered in the load level line.
