# Work Planes - An Introduction

## Definition and Attributes

## What is a work plane? Definition of the first work plane

-   *In the training project, we create a building position AE0 with the template without default values.*

-   In D-CAM we choose "Display settings work planes Favorite 1"und "Grid settings Favorite 1:"

> Notes

-   We create a \"general constant cross section\" with the alignment parallel Z at the origin of the vertical working plane.

> To enter the 2D drawing elements in the work planes, they are automatically rotated into their view.

-   Working planes allow input in the comfortable 2D mode.

-   The use of all 3D functions remains unrestricted.

## Definition of work planes in general

> In the training project D-CAM work planes, we open the building position AE1

-   For the display settings, we select \"Favorite 1: Beams from roof, wall, ceiling and trusses\".

## Typical cases of work planes

> There are four functions for defining work planes. These should lead as quickly as possible to the work planes normally required.

> Notes

## The horizontal work plane

-   We select the icon for the work plane horizontally and a top corner of the plate.

> With 2x right mouse clicks we get a new work plane. Their X-alignment is automatically global X, the position of the origin is automatically only vertically offset.

+=======================================================================================================+========================================================================================================+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

> A horizontal work plane rotated in the ground is achieved with three clicks:

-   Choose an upper corner point of the angled beam for the height,

-   choose a longitudinal edge of this beam for the X-alignment,

-   then re-select the corner point for the original position.

## The vertical work plane

-   To create the vertical working plane, we select the appropriate icon and the top corner of the plate. Confirm the following question about the viewing direction with a right mouse click.

> The program automatically creates a work plane that is vertical, whose X axis is horizontal, and whose selected line is completely in the positive range, with the start of the line at the origin.
>
> In principle, this applies to all vertical working planes regardless of the orientation of the selected line in space.
>
> Notes

-   We select a rafter lower edge for the next work plane:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## The arbitrary work plane

> The arbitrary work plane is the most flexible form of the work planes. It is possible to create this work plane by selecting a component surface or by points and lines.

## Arbitrary work plane: surface selection

-   With four surfaces of a rafter, we will create a work plane for each surface.

-   All four arbitrary work planes are now automatically generated in such a way, that

    -   the direction of view on the component shows (i.e. the component is behind the surface),

    -   X is horizontal,

    -   the selected component surface lies completely in the first quadrant:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Arbitrary work plane: selection of points and lines

> When creating work planes using points and lines, the first two points always define the X direction, the third point then always points in the Y direction. Therefore, X can also lie diagonally in the space.

-   We create a work plane on the top of a frame:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+===========================================================================================+=========================================================================================================+========================================================================================================+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Notes
>
> If the component edge in the image is selected at the lower end, then the work plane lies on the frame. If the component edge is selected at the upper end, the component is then on the work plane. The end of the line closer to the click point is interpreted as the first point.

## The work plane on the component axis

> This option is useful if further input is to be orientated on a component.

-   The work plane is then created selectively parallel to the component height or to the component width,

-   it runs through the component axis,

-   it has its origin at the beginning of the component, and the component then always lies in the first quadrant.

> We create a work planes with the component axis of the rafter. These two possibilities arise:
>
> The functions for defining work plane should lead as quickly as possible and easily to the work plane regularly required.

## Selection of work planes

> Notes

## Positioning work planes

> Work planes can be moved, rotated and moved parallel. The viewing direction of a work plane can also be changed. With \"Mouse Right", a work plane can be selected at its origin or at the outer boundary line.
>
> Important:

-   **Components** are and always independent of the work plane. If work planes are changed or deleted, the components are always retained.

-   **2D plan elements** retain their special position only when moving and rotating working planes.

-   **2D plan elements** move along when work planes are offset in parallel.

-   We select the first vertical work plane from 1.1.2.3 and the option \"Change origin\".

-   With 3 we open the coordinate input and define a displacement of the origin in the XoY plane, i.e. within the work plane.

-   When prompted for the X direction, we open the coordinate input with 2 and set the angle to the X-axis to 30°. The length must be \> 0,000 -- otherwise it does not work!

![](./media-workplanes/media/image50.png){width="6.25168416447944in" height="2.8879166666666665in"}

> Notes

-   If we want to move without rotation, we quit the *second* step with mouse right.

-   If we want to rotate only, we select the origin with mouse left and enter in the *second* step any length \> zero.

![](./media-workplanes/media/image51.png){width="4.020534776902887in" height="1.5837489063867016in"}

-   We select the option \"Change view direction\". The work plane is immediately rotated 180° about its Y axis.

## Properties of work planes

1.  **Work planes are generally unlimited.**

> The work planes are infinitely large. The viewing area of a work plane has a variable size. Input in the working plane is possible at any time outside the viewing area.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image56.png){width="4.578581583552056in" height="1.89in"}We create a post in the work plane that was modified and select the plate end as the positioning point.

> The plate endpoint is projected into the working plane outside its visible area to create the post.

## Detailed inputs,

-   **Component input,**

-   **Building input,**

> The setting of the work plane that was last selected with Dialog is reused when a new work plane is created.
>
> When creating a new work plane, you can first accept the offered setting and then select the desired favorite.
>
> The grid of a work plane can be switched off and on again at any time during input with the short cut key \"R\".

-   We select a component for input and, while the component outline is visible at the crosshairs, press the shortcut key \"R\" several times.

## Input in Work Planes

## Input of components in work planes

> In the training project we open the building position AE2

-   We choose the display settings favorite 1: \"Beams from roof, wall, floor deck and truss \"

-   We select the work plane \"Vertical plate\" and switch off the other components.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image69.jpeg){width="6.424199475065617in" height="3.7712489063867016in"}We enter a post .120x.120x2.000 in Y-direction:

> There is no Depth Position: as in walls and ceilings when entering beam and profile beams in work planes. This must be taken into account for the depth positioning.

-   We switch on the remaining components.

-   We select the work plane \"Inclined on rafters\".

-   We distribute between the rafters, trimmers (8x20), starting at the eaves point. The upper end of the distribution is the lower perpendicular section point angled on the top of the rafters:

> Before copying, it is essential to switch to the vertical work plane on the outside of the plate: this will catch the corner of the bird's mouth when reading the element, which is important for positioning at the front edge of the plate. If you remain in the inclined working plane, then this is not possible!

-   When copying parts to the clipboard, their alignment to the current work plane is of crucial importance! A point that is to be used as an insertion point during positioning must lie directly in the work plane during copying.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image85.png){width="6.264645669291339in" height="6.086770559930009in"}For this we set (with 4-1-1 and B for reference point) a 3D auxiliary geometry point at the top of the support timber:

-   We create the arbitrary work plane, as shown in the picture. The order of the points is important so that the coordinate system of the plane fits!

-   Then we create the first leg of the saw horse (trestle) with a cross-section of 0.080 x 0.080 as component input in the working plane with 2-1-4 as constant cross-section, beam along X. It makes sense to set the Positioning Point to Choice.

-   To connect the leg to the support timber, we first switch to the global work plane and generate two horizontal cuts with 3-4-3; bottom to global zero, top with an offset of 0.020 from OK support timber.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image88.jpeg){width="4.998330052493438in" height="2.2993744531933507in"}In addition, with 3-4-7 on the leg we create a vertical cut parallel axis support timber, to avoid a collision with the opposite leg with 0.003 offset:

> The leg is now to be connected to the saw horse (trestle) with an angled end lap notched 0.020 parallel into the side surface of the support timber.

-   With 9-2-5 we create a vertical work plane, named \"angled end lap\", as shown in the picture:

-   With the function 2-1-7 beam 2 points we position a board with 0,020 thickness and 0,080 width at the connection from the upper leg end to the support timber.

-   We switch to the Global System and create a 3D point in the middle of the top support timber.

-   Then we mirror the auxiliary part for creating the notch with 2-7-5 on the axis of the support timber, then we copy both auxiliary parts with 2-7-3 around the new auxiliary geometry point and a parallel to Global Z by 180°.

-   With 3-8-1 we produce the connection in the support timber with lap joint. The fixed depth of the lap (in the input dialog of the processing the beam is 1) is 0,000.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image92.png){width="6.053206474190726in" height="2.8525in"}Then the lap in the support timber is disband and the help timbers are deleted.

-   We create another arbitrary working plane \"longitudinal bracing\" by selecting the outer corner points of two legs in the longitudinal direction and the upper corner point of the same edge on the right leg; the work plane gets a grid area of 1,000 x 1,000:

-   With the created board we now create a lap joint with full board thickness of 0.020 and disband this connection lap joint in both legs, creating a free lap joint.

> We delete the board and then create the actual longitudinal strut in the same length using the settings as for the Andreas cross (W x H = 0.060 x 0.060).

-   We cut the longitudinal brace at the ends flush with the surface of the legs.

> Now we create a V-cut. A birds mouth is not possible here because the angle between the legs and the longitudinal brace is 93.45°. Therefore, we customize the longitudinal brace with 3-6-1 by a V-cut and the option \< four points \>, with selection of the longitudinal brace for the V-cut and point selection on the leg in the order shown:

-   Above it we set (with 2-1-4) as \" beam along X\" a glulam beam, 0.160 x 0.240, with a cross section rotated by 90°, because the width of a component (as in roof and ceiling) always indicates its view:

-   Parallel to global X, a plate is now to be placed on the rear corner of the building. For this purpose, we create another vertical working plane \"Eaves wall at the back\", with the zero point opposite the global origin and view from the outside onto the carport, a grid area of 7,000 x 3,500 and grid size 0,100 x 0,100.

-   Step 2: we offset (with 03-5) the left edge of the view of our work plane by 0.850 to the outside and therefore define the roof overhang for the rafter layer.

-   Step 3: from the ridge point centered above the frame and at a height of 5,000 we draw a line (starting with 02-3-1) then (call snap point with \"T\") tangent to the circle, and so define the direction for OK rafters.

-   Step 4: by adjusting the second line to the first (with 03-8) we find the eave point of the rafters for our carport.

-   Now we enter C24 rafters 0.080 x 0.240 on the plate and use the distribute function in the \"Parallel Y\" input dialog box. We use a gable rafter to measure the length.

-   As the starting point we select a point on the X axis of our working plane, as the limits for the distribution we select one point each on the inside of the gable rafters.

> 6\) for \"beam-angle\".

-   Please note: a 90° rotation of the cross section is required to install the brace with the wide side vertical.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The depth position is 0.020 so that they sit centered under the plates.

-   For the right Brace on the center post, the tilt angle is 45°, Positioning point: corner 1.

-   The left Brace on the corner post is positioned with 135° inclination, Positioning point: corner 2.

-   Connection at both ends are hidden Step joints: with 0.020 depth

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   As reference point for the lower end we choose the corner between post and plate, then 1,000 distance in -Y. With the setting "Connect: All" the brace gets automatically connected with the plate, too.

-   Then we copy (with 2-7-1) the brace to the left. The origin point is the upper left corner point of the corner post, the destination point is the upper left corner point of the middle post.

-   For the installation of a C24 Andreas Brace with a cross section of 0,040 x 0,200 in the gable triangle we change to the work plane \"gable wall\" and create (with 02-2-1 and \"B\" reference point) a point 1,150 below the ridge.

-   From this point, we draw a piece of line at 45° in the direction of the rafters, using the snap functions.

-   Then we offset the line (with 03-5) upwards by 0.100 and adjust it (with 03-8) to the bottom of the plate and top of the rafter, with which an upper side of the Andreas cross is fixed.

-   Now we move the working plane (with 9-2-05) back by 0.020. To do this, we select its zero point as reference point and enter a shift of -0.020 in the Z direction. This moves the auxiliary point at the Andreas brace in the direction of the component center.

-   Then we change to the work plane \"Base\" and copy (with 2-7-3) the brace around the Z-axis with the previously moved point as pivot by 180°.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image127.jpeg){width="3.20419728783902in" height="2.4125in"}Finally, we lap joint both beams (with 3-8-1, depth of notched beam 1: bisect).

> Notes

-   To create the second half of the carport we switch to the work plane \"Back eaves wall\", activate all parts and copy \[with Ctrl+C\] to the clipboard.

-   Then we change to the work plane "base area" and create another vertical work plane with the name \"Front eaves wall\", whose origin and direction of the X-axis is identical to the global X-direction.

-   We rotate this work plane into the view and select \[Ctrl+V\] to insert the second half of the carport.

> The \"Read element\" window opens. All points and lines visible here are a perpendicular projection into the work plane \"Back eaves wall\", which was current during the copy process. In order to insert all parts in the new work plane \"Front eaves wall\", we should select a point that is easy to find in this work plane.

-   After the insertion we check the connections of the components. On each gable side a wall brace and a beam of the Andreas brace at one end ran into the void, although they had been produced with a connection process. We create these connections again (with 3-1-7) form new connection.

-   The rafters are connected by end laps (with 3-8-2).

> Notes

-   We connect the plate end above the global zero point and the diagonally opposite plate end to the frame and post as for the other two corners, with end laps and tenons (3 -8-2 and 3- 01-1, accordingly).

-   To enter joist from purlin to purlin, we raise the working plane \"Base area\" (with 9-2-05) by 3.240, and hide all parts except plates.

-   We place a beam 0.160 x 0.200 parallel to the gable plates in the middle of the field and connect it with dovetail tenons, as shown in the next picture:

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image130.jpeg){width="6.0721052055993in" height="2.7408333333333332in"}

-   We then distribute 4 joists of 0.120 x 0.200 with the same connections in each of the two lateral fields.

# Work planes - Example of an application on a pavilion

> The pavilion is used to apply and practice the explanations of work planes from Training Part 1, Introduction.
>
> When entering components in the work plane, the depth positioning is always flush with the front unless otherwise specified.
>
> The unit for all length specifications is meter.
>
> We create a new building P01

-   We create a horizontal work plane in parallel X. The zero point of this plane is global zero, the X directions are identical.

-   Name: \"Floor\", 10,000 x 10,000, with a grid of 0,500.

-   First, we draw a pentagon in this plane as a floor plan for our pavilion.

-   We create a 2D line parallel X, start point about 3,000 in direction X, from zero, with a length of 2,5000.

-   We copy this line at both ends by 54° in the arc and create a triangle, were the lines cross each other use the \"Corner\" function to connect them.

-   We copy the base line and the left triangle line around the tip of the triangle 4x with 72° in the arc and get the pentagon with connecting lines from the corners to the center point.

> Notes

-   We create a vertical working plane \"Front\" parallel X, zero point and grid as before

-   We position 2 posts 0.120 x 0.120 x 1.500 at the ends of the base line with \" beam along Y\".

> Note: with the \"Choice\" option for (Positioning point:), we can quickly place both posts with their outer corners at the line ends.

-   ![](./media-workplanes/media/image133.jpeg){width="6.384616141732283in" height="2.5395833333333333in"}We place with \" beam along X\", a Plate 0.120 x 0.120 x 2.500 on top of the posts.

-   We\'re switching to the global system.

-   We place an help rafter on the frame with \"Constant section\": General 0.120 x 0.120 x 2.000, length addition beginning 1.000, 90° GW, 60° NW. A Z-shift of 0.170 corresponds to a perpendicular Obholz of 17cm. We position the help rafter with corner 3 on the left front Plate corner.

> Note: with this positioning we can directly measure the perpendicular Obholz.

-   At the bottom of the top of rafters we create an Arbitrary work plane \"Roof\" with the dimensions 5,000 x 5,000, grid as before.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image134.png){width="1.0225557742782152in" height="1.2663024934383202in"}Note: in order for the front side of the work plane to face upwards and originate at the bottom end of the beam, the top plane of the rafter should be selected. The selection of edges or corner points of this surface is also possible, but can lead to other orientations of the work plane.

-   The help rafter can be deleted.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image135.png){width="6.2980260279965in" height="3.236978346456693in"}

-   We create 2 tilted slanting rafters at right angles to each other with the dimensions 0.120x0.200x2.000 in the work plane \"Roof\" using \"Beam Angle\". The positioning is carried out using the ends of the plates on the front edge. On the left corner the orientation is 45° with the positioning point 2, on the right 135° and the point 1.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image136.png){width="6.328992782152231in" height="3.1303116797900263in"}Note: the corners of the frame are angled in the work plane.

-   We lap joint these two rafters.

> Notes

-   We create the dormer ridge plate in the work plane \"Roof\" with \"constant cross section\" with the dimensions 0.120 x 0.120 x 2.000, \"additional length at origin ZA:\" 1.500, parallel Z, corner 4, Tilt angle 45°. Positioning point is the top outside crossing point of the rafters.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image137.jpeg){width="6.266070647419073in" height="3.5654155730533685in"}

-   We create as 3D assisting geometry line (with 4-3-3), \"Intersection line 2 planes\" thus not belonging to a work plane, the intersection line lays between the work planes \"Front\" and \"Roof\".

> Note: The Plate front and top planes of the rafters can be selected for creating this line.

-   We create with \"beam along X\" in the work plane \"roof\" a tilted Trimmer between the inclined rafters. The dimensions are 0.120 x 0.200, the trimmers lower edge is the help line.

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image138.jpeg){width="3.0076531058617673in" height="1.3325in"}

-   We create two intersection points of the rafter outer edges with the work plane with assisting geometry (4-1-1), \"Single point\".

> Notes
>
> A work plane should now run through the cutting line of the working planes or through the front edge of the Trimmer, which tilts 30° outwards from the \"Front\" work plane. Its Z-axis should be directed downwards so that component inputs (front flush) are above this plane. This is how the slanting dormer Verge rafters are to be created.

-   We change to the Global System.

-   We create a help rafter 0.120 x 0.200 x 2.000, 90° GW, 120° NW, positioning with Axis on the top middle of the Trimmer with \"Constant section General\".

> ![](./media-workplanes/media/image139.jpeg){width="6.232740594925635in" height="2.7168744531933506in"}

-   On the underside of the help rafter we create the arbitrary work plane \"dormer front below\", size and grid as before.

> Note: When selecting a surface for the work plane, selecting the bottom side of the rafter this will give you desired alignment of Z of this plane.

-   The help rafter can be deleted.

-   We move the work plane \"dormer front bottom\" parallel to the Trimmer and move the origin to the left intersection point.

-   We cut off the dormer ridge plate at the top parallel to this work plane.

-   In this work plane we create the \"slanting verge rafters\" with the option \"Beam 2 points\" 0,120 x 0,200x 2,500 and position them with the side 2-3 or 1-4.

-   Afterwards we lap joint the dormer verge rafters.

> Notes

-   Then we create the birds mouths with the bottom side of the gable ridge in both verge rafters. (3-7-1) Birds mouth

> Note: Set the \"Edge to create birds' mouth\": to Choice.

-   Finally we cut both rafters flush with the top of the dormer ridge plate. (3-4-1) General

![](./media-workplanes/media/image144.jpeg){width="6.322268153980753in" height="2.814478346456693in"}

-   Both Verge rafters are connected to the main rafters with \"birds' mouth\" and the main rafters are also connected to the Plate with \"birds' mouth\".

-   In the work plane \"Roof\" we create a vertical 2D line (length 3,000) through the middle of our previous construction, origin in the middle of the trimmer.

-   We create four more [vertical work planes]{.underline} on each side of the pentagon with the names [\"left\"]{.underline}, [\"right\"]{.underline}, \"[rear left]{.underline}\" and \"[rear right]{.underline}\"; the Z-axis points outwards for all of them; grid same as for \"front\".

> Note: when selecting a line to create a vertical working plane, the program first offers the end of the line as the zero point, which is closer to the click point.

-   We change to the work plane \"Front\", activate and copy plate, right post and right main rafter to the clipboard (Ctrl+C).

-   We switch to the work plane \"left\". Here we insert the lower post end on the right intersection of the pentagon (Ctrl+V).

-   We delete the three components copied to the left work plane.

-   Switch to the \"Front\" work plane, activate and copy all components to the clipboard.

-   Change to the work plane \"left\", insert all parts from the clipboard.

-   On the left roof surface, connect the two main rafters to the right hip rafter as before and disband the processes with the \$ sign.
